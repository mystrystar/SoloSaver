To Solve:
Food delivery platforms make it costly or impossible for solo users to place small-value orders due to high delivery fees and minimum cart restrictions. Despite being in densely populated areas, users can't tap into the demand around them — there’s no way to discover nearby strangers ordering from the same restaurant to combine orders. As a result, small cravings go unfulfilled, carts are abandoned, and platforms miss out on high-frequency low-AOV transactions.

😣 User Frustrations

“I was craving just a sandwich but had to add ₹200 more to avoid the delivery charge.”

“Why can’t I join someone else’s order? I know 10 other people in this apartment are ordering too.”

“Feels unfair that I pay the same ₹50 delivery fee for a ₹120 snack as someone ordering ₹800 worth of food.”

“There’s no way to split delivery with people I don’t know. Why can’t I pool my order like we do with Uber rides?”
